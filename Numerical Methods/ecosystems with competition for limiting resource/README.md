This is a project based on the article "The effects of seasonality on competition for a limiting resource" by Lluc Briganti Wiprachtige. The intention at first was
to explore how to model phenomena using Ordinary Differential Equations. With this project, we explored how certain factors influence in the competition of two
individuals in such an environment.
