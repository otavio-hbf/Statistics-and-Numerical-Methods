ohbf_miniprojeto_copas: this was one of the first projects I did with this stack. I had vague knowledge about the tools I was using, but still was able to finish the task.
Not in the most clear and sophisticated way, but with the time restraints I had, I can say that I am satisfied with the result. 

Lista1_estatistica: That's a task from the first of the Statistics lists, I had to compare the perfomance of 3 types of sorting. This was a great task to start to get the
hang of how matplotlib and numpy works.
